    // IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
    // ====================
    //
    // We emulate strict IEEE-754 rules, including the packing of values
    // into 64-bit words. In order to compute the rounding properly, we
    // use two guard bits, one of which being "sticky":
    //
    //   Intermediate values are kept over 55 bits, in the [2^54, 2^55-1]
    //   range (i.e. two extra bits compared to the final output).
    //
    //   Least significant bit of the 55-bit value is set to 1 if any of
    //   the lower bits (which were dropped) was non-zero. This is what
    //   makes that bit "sticky". The sticky bit tracks whether the result
    //   was exactly the 55-bit value, or was in fact slightly higher.
    //
    // When rounding a 55-bit value with a sticky bit, the value is
    // is right-shifted by 2, but we must then add 1 if the low three
    // bits of the 55-bit value were 011, 110 or 111. The addition of 1
    // may trigger a carry that will yield 2^53 at the end; this is
    // actually correct because that will indirectly increment the exponent,
    // which is exactly what we want. In other words, given s, e and m such
    // that:
    //    s = 0 or 1
    //    m is in [2^54, 2^55-1]
    //    The value is (-1)^s*m*2^e
    // then we round and assemble them with:
    //    (s << 63) + ((e + 1076) << 52) + (m >> 2) + cc
    // where cc = 1 if the low three bits of m are 011, 110 or 111, or
    // cc = 0 otherwise. Note that the high bit of the shifted m is here
    // added to the "e" field, which is why we encode e + 1076 and not
    // e + 1077.
    //
    // cc can be computed as:
    //    cc = (0xC8 >> (m & 7)) & 1
    // or also:
    //    z = (m & (m >> 1))
    //    cc = (z | (z >> 1)) & 1

    // This function makes a new value out of the provided sign bit s,
    // exponent e, and mantissa. Rules:
    //    Only the low bit of s is used (0 or 1), the upper bits are ignored.
    //    For a non-zero value:
    //       2^54 <= m < 2^55, low bit is sticky
    //       value is (-1)^s * 2^e * m and is appropriately rounded
    //       no exponent overflow occurs
